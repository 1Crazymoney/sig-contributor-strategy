# Contributor Growth

The Contributor Growth subproject is interested in assisting CNCF projects with
sustainably growing their contributor base.

## Goals

* Provide best practices and resources for managing and interacting with
  contributors to CNCF projects.
* Provide guidance on building a contributor pipeline that brings in new
  contributors and promotes them to higher levels of responsibility within CNCF
  projects, including the maintainer role.

## Scope

* Templates for common documents like a contributing guide, reviewing guide,
  maintainers guide, contribution ladder, etc.
* Case studies of sucessful projects of various kinds/sizes and how they manage
  contributions.
* Collect and share talks related to the subproject's mission, for example
  building open source communities, or reflections on a particular community's
  best practices.
* Document ways to contribute to a project, especially roles outside of the
  obvious feature enhancement/code contributions.
* Create spaces for maintainers of CNCF projects to share their own best
  practices and ask questions.
* Discuss non-code areas that support contributor growth, such as project
  management, design, user experience and documentation and how CNCF projects
  can prioritize work that may not be the maintainers primary skillset.
* Provide materials that a CNCF project can use to address the TOC [due
  dilligence guidelines] related to project's contributors and community.

### Out-of-Scope

The following are exmaples of things out-of-scope:

* Project governance.
* Project automation, such as prow.
* Day to day support for improving the contribution experience for CNCF
  projects. That falls under other projects, for example Kubernetes SIG
  Contributor Experience.
