# Maintainer's Circle

Placeholder for the Maintainer's Circle subproject [proposed here](https://github.com/cncf/sig-contributor-strategy/issues/1).

## Goals:
Bring CNCF project maintainersðŸ”¹ together to:
- Collaborate on strategic issues; tackling size:L OSS challenges together
- Listening (to build better programs, relationships, and sustainability efforts)
- Share Best Practices
- Participate in peer coaching and seek guidance  
- Highlight successes

ðŸ”¹Maintainer Definition  
A maintainer is anyone recognized as a maintainer or core role of a project by
that project's standards and governance. You can maintain code and/or docs.
Relevant CNCF project examples:  
- [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainership) lists maintainers and code reviewers as key role
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
lists maintainers in a MAINTAINERS.md file
- [Kubernetes](owners link)
doesn't use the word maintainers but uses an OWNERs file method for ownership by
listing reviewers and approvers

We recognize the term does not apply across the board perfectly. Maintainers
is an umbrella succinct term that covers many of your roles and inclusivity.

Important note: CNCF has a pool of listed maintainers for each project that vote on behalf of their project in TOC
elections. This circle is open to all types of maintainers.
